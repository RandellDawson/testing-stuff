Attention non-English reviewers of Curriculum Challenge PRs Please see my comment on freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp#35365. If you see differences between the code blocks on the current English master version of the challenges (not Guide articles), it would be great if you can create an issue and/or ask the contributor of the PR to possibly create a new PR if you see any changes in scope of the challenge description or instructions when looking at the latest English version on the master branch. The review process of the non-English reviewers is actually more complicated, because you need to check that the last commit date/time to the file on the equivalent English version of the challenge is not greater than the date of the PR. If the PR date is less, then this is a clue for you to make sure the English version has not made significant changes to the challenge's description/instructions and the test section has not been altered (i.e. no additional tests, deleted tests, improved test).

An alternate approach is instead of you taking the time to look for changes yourself, just compare the dates and make a generic comment regarding the fact that the English version has changed since their PR was created and you would like them to please review the latest English version again and make any translations needed to get them to match. If after 21 days, nothing is fixed and no response is given, then you actually do your review by comparing the current English vs on master compared to the overall content showing in the PR. You can then just close with applicable message letting the contributor know they need to review master again and submit a new PR after updating their fork.

There are probably a couple of other ways to approach this, but I think the 2nd approach above will help in conjunction with using the Moderator Tools' Pareto view (see below). There are many challenge files across some of the languages which have multiple PRs against them and most have situations where the English version has been changed.

Sorry for the long text. @raisedadead Should I create an issue for this where this can be discussed on GitHub or should we setup a meeting with some of the non-English reviewers to draft out a policy around this to streamline the review process for all these very old translation PR which have diverged from the English master versions.
